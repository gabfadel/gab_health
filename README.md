# GAB Health

GAB Health is a web application for managing healthcare workflows: user registration, doctor management, appointment scheduling, medication lookup, and medical records.

---

## 1. Doctor Creation (Admin Panel)

1. **Create superuser** (if not already created):

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d        # start services
   docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow prompts to set username, email, and password for the admin.

2. **Start the application** (if not already running):

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Open the admin interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin).

4. Log in as superuser.

5. Navigate to **Users** (the built-in User model) and click **Add User**.

6. Fill in required fields:

   - **Username**
   - **Email** (used for login)
   - **Password**

7. In the same form, locate the **isDoctor** checkbox under the custom fields section. Check **isDoctor** to designate this user as a doctor.

8. Save the user. A new **Doctor** entry is automatically available via the `/api/doctors/` endpoints for any user with `isDoctor = true`.

You can verify:

- In the admin panel, use **Users** list and confirm the new user has **yes** under the **isDoctor** column.
- Using the API: `GET /api/doctors/` should list the new doctor user.
